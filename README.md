<small>:construction: This repo is still under early development.</small>

An attempt on making an RM (RPG Maker) IDE.

The name _**rrnide**_ comes from splitting __*m*__ to **_rn_**, meaning that some files of this project was part of RM itself.

## Usage

### Requirements

- To build dll: GCC and `make` in your PATH.
- To run the server: Ruby and MSYS2 in your PATH.

    (rgss/mailslot.dll (x86) and mailslot/mailslot.dll (x64) are built)
    > bundle
    (Midori.rb is installed)
